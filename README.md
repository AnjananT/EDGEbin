# Inspiration
As the world is pushed to the edge of environmental crisis, the notion of sorting your waste has become increasingly crucial. However, as you have probably noticed, many individuals simply don't care enough to sort their trash. Our team has long experienced this indifference firsthand, holding onto the hope that society would eventually recognize the importance of waste sorting. Yet, here we are, balancing on the precipice, surrounded by unsorted garbage and apathy. That's why we decided it was finally time for a change with the AI-powered EDGEbinâ€”a step towards a more mindful and sustainable future. 

##What it does
The EDGEbin utilizes artificial intelligence and a clever mechanical system to do automatically identify and sort your trash into four categories: trash, recycling, electronic, and organic. All you have to do is toss your trash into the funnel.
